Classwork - JavaScript Basics

Create an HTML file called ```index.html`` 

Add JavaScript inline (using <script> tags) that does the following:

* Defines a string variable called ```name``` and assign it your name

* Defines a numeric variable called ```age``` that contains your age

* Write the code to log ```My name is YOURNAME and I am YOURAGE``` in the developer console

var myName  = "Gerren";
var age = 33;
console.log("My name is "+myName+ " and I am "+ age);
